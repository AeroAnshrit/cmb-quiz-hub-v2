    {
      "chapter": "Fluid Mechanics",
      "question": "A hydraulic press has a ram of 15 cm diameter and plunger of 1.5 cm. It is required to lift a mass of 1000 kg. The force required on plunger is nearly equal to",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "100N",
        "1000N",
        "10000N",
        "10N"
      ],
      "answer": "100N",
      "explanation": "By Archimedes principle, F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂. F₁ = F₂ × (A₁/A₂). F₁ = (1000kg × g) × (π(1.5)²/4) / (π(15)²/4) = 10000 × (1.5/15)² = 10000 × (1/100) = 100N."

      "chapter": "Fluid Mechanics",
      "question": "If the stream function is given by Ψ = 3xy, then the velocity at a point (2, 3) will be",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "7.21 unit",
        "18 unit",
        "10.82 unit",
        "54 unit"
      ],
      "answer": "10.82 unit",
      "explanation": "Given stream function ψ = 3xy. Velocity components are u = ∂ψ/∂y = 3x and v = -∂ψ/∂x = -3y. At point (2, 3), u = 3(2) = 6 and v = -3(3) = -9. Resultant velocity = √(u² + v²) = √(6² + (-9)²) = √(36 + 81) = √117 ≈ 10.82 units."

        "Impeller, Suction pipe, Foot valve and strainer, Deliver pipe",
        "Foot valve and strainer, Suction pipe, Impeller, Deliver pipe",
        "Impeller, Suction pipe, Deliver pipe, Foot valve and strainer",
        "Suction pipe, Deliver pipe, Impeller, Foot valve and strainer"
      ],
      "answer": "Foot valve and strainer, Suction pipe, Impeller, Deliver pipe",
      "explanation": "The sequence of the centrifugal pump is 'Foot valve and strainer, suction pipe, Impeller, Delivery pipe'."

        "Only reversible adiabatic process",
        "Only irreversible adiabatic process",
        "Only isothermal process"
      ],
      "answer": "Only reversible adiabatic process",
      "explanation": "PV^γ = constant. Where, γ = Cp/Cv. The above relation is valid for adiabatic & reversible process only for ideal gas."

        "static pressure and the static temperature rise",
        "entropy remains constant",
        "velocity and static pressure decrease",
        "density and temperature decrease"
      ],
      "answer": "static pressure and the static temperature rise",
      "explanation": "The shock wave is perpendicular to the flow direction it is called a normal shock. Across a normal shock static pressure and the static temperature rise almost instantaneously."
