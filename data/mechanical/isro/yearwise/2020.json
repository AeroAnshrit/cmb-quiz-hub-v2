      "question": "A centrifugal pump having an impeller diameter of 127 mm, delivers a power of 12 hp. If the impeller diameter is changed to 254 mm, what is the power, if other parameters are kept constant?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "48 hp",
        "192 hp",
        "24 hp",
        "96 hp"
      ],
      "answer": "96 hp",
      "explanation": "As per the affinity laws, the relationship between power (P) and diameter of impeller (D) is given by P ∝ D³. Therefore, P₂/P₁ = (D₂/D₁)³. P₂ = 12 * (254/127)³ = 12 * 2³ = 12 * 8 = 96 hp."

      "question": "In a circular tube of diameter 100 mm and length 13 m with laminar flow, the friction factor is estimated to be 0.05. Calculate the Reynolds number?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "950",
        "2300",
        "1280",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "1280",
      "explanation": "For laminar flow in a circular tube, the friction factor (f) is related to the Reynolds number (Re) by the formula f = 64 / Re. Therefore, Re = 64 / f = 64 / 0.05 = 1280."

      "question": "An open tank is filled with water to a height of 20 m. What is the velocity of the water flow at the outlet, if the outlet is at the base of the tank?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "40 m/s (approx.)",
        "20 m/s (approx.)",
        "10 m/s (approx.)",
        "5 m/s (approx.)"
      ],
      "answer": "20 m/s (approx.)",
      "explanation": "According to Torricelli's law, the velocity of efflux (v) from an orifice at a depth h is given by v = √(2gh). Here, v = √(2 * 10 m/s² * 20 m) = √400 = 20 m/s."

      "chapter": "Fluid Mechanics",
      "question": "For a non-dimensional specific speed value of 1, for maximum efficiency, which of the following turbines is preferred?",
      "image": "[IMAGE_HERE]",
      "options": [
        "Pelton wheel",
        "Francis turbine",
        "Kaplan turbine",
        "Tyson wheel"
      ],
      "answer": "Francis turbine",
      "explanation": "Based on the efficiency vs. non-dimensional specific speed chart, the Francis turbine shows maximum efficiency for a specific speed value around 1."

      "chapter": "Fluid Mechanics",
      "question": "An experiment is conducted with a fluid of density 1 kg/m³ at 10 m/s velocity. The free stream static pressure is 100 kPa and the local static pressure is 101 kPa. What is the pressure coefficient at the location?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "70",
        "80",
        "20",
        "50"
      ],
      "answer": "20",
      "explanation": "The pressure coefficient (Cp) is calculated as Cp = (P_local - P_freestream) / (0.5 * ρ * v²). Cp = (101000 - 100000) / (0.5 * 1 * 10²) = 1000 / 50 = 20."

      "question": "In a P-V diagram of a steady flow compressor, the intercooling can be represented as",
      "image": "[IMAGE_HERE]",
      "options": [
        "Vertical line",
        "Horizontal line",
        "Parabolic line",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "Horizontal line",
      "explanation": "Intercooling in a multi-stage compressor is a constant pressure process. On a P-V diagram, a constant pressure process is represented by a horizontal line."
