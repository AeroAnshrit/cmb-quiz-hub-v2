    {
      "chapter": "Material Science",
      "question": "Which material has the highest value of Poisson's ratio?",
      "options": ["Rubber", "Steel", "Glass", "Copper"],
      "answer": "Rubber",
      "explanation": "Rubber has the highest value of Poisson's ratio, which is close to 0.5, indicating it's nearly incompressible."
    },
    {
      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "The efficiency of a Carnot engine depends upon?",
      "options": ["The working substance", "The temperatures of the source and sink", "The design of the engine", "The type of fuel used"],
      "answer": "The temperatures of the source and sink",
      "explanation": "The efficiency of a Carnot engine is solely dependent on the absolute temperatures of the hot source (T1) and the cold sink (T2), given by the formula Î· = 1 - (T2/T1)."
