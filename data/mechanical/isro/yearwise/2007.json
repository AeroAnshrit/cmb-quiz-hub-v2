      "chapter": "Aerospace Engineering",
      "question": "Only rocket engines can be propelled to space because",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "They can generate very high thrust",
        "They have high propulsion efficiency",
        "These engines can work on several fuels",
        "They are not air-breathing engines"
      ],
      "answer": "They are not air-breathing engines",
      "explanation": "On earth, air tends to inhibit the exhaust gases from the engine (rocket), it reduce the thrust. However in space there is no atmosphere, the exhaust gases can exit much easier and faster, thus increasing the thrust. Thrust depends upon the speed of the exhaust gases and the mass of gas being expelled each second. Therefore the rocket engine actually works better in space than here on earth."

      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "The universal gas constant of a gas is the product of molecular weight of the gas and",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Gas constant",
        "Specific heat at constant pressure",
        "Specific heat at constant volume",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "Gas constant",
      "explanation": "PV = mRT. We know that, No. of mole (n) = m/M, so, m = nM and PV = mRT, PV = nMRT where R = gas characteristic constant, n = No. of mole, m = molecular mass, M = molecular weight, R_bar = universal gas constant, T = Temperature. PV = nMRT, so R_bar = MR."

      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "Vander Waal's equation of state of a gas is",

      "options": [
        "PV = nRT",
        "(p + a/v²)(v + b) = RT",
        "(p + a/v²)(v - b) = RT",
        "(p - a/v²)(v - b) = RT"
      ],
      "answer": "(p + a/v²)(v - b) = RT",
      "explanation": "Vander Waal's equation (p + a/V²)(v - b) = RT where a/V² = Account for intermolecular force (force of cohesion), a = account for existence of mutual attraction between the molecules, b = Account of co-volume (volume of molecules), R = Gas characteristic constant."

      "chapter": "Heat Transfer",
      "question": "The radiative heat transfer rate per unit area (W/m²) between two plane parallel grey surfaces (emissivity = 0.9) maintained at 400 K and 300 K is (Stefan Boltzmann constant σ = 5.67 × 10⁻⁸ W/m² K⁴)",

        "992",
        "812",
        "464",
        "567"
      ],
      "answer": "812",
      "explanation": "Given, ε = 0.9, T₁ = 400K, T₂ = 300 K, σ = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴. Heat transfer per unit area between parallel grey surface is given by Q/A = σ(T₁⁴ - T₂⁴) / (1/ε₁ + 1/ε₂ - 1). With ε₁=ε₂=ε, Q/A = σ(T₁⁴ - T₂⁴) / (2/ε - 1) = [5.67×10⁻⁸(400⁴ - 300⁴)] / (2/0.9 - 1) = 811.84 W/m² ≈ 812 W/m²."

        "η > ηR",
        "η < ηR",
        "η ≥ ηR",
        "η ≤ ηR"
      ],
      "answer": "η ≤ ηR",
      "explanation": "η = efficiency of any heat engine, ηR = Reversible heat engine. So, η ≤ ηR. Any heat engine must also include reversible heat engine or Carnot engine."
