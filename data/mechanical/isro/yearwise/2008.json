    {
      "chapter": "Material Science",
      "question": "The ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of most of the metals, when temperature falls from 0 to -150°C will",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Increase",
        "Decrease",
        "Remain same",
        "First increase and then decrease"
      ],
      "answer": "Increase",
      "explanation": "For most metals, both yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase as the temperature decreases into cryogenic ranges. The material becomes stronger but often less ductile."

    {
      "chapter": "Material Science",
      "question": "'Troosite' is obtained when",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Quenching steel during transformation",
        "A fully hardened steel is finally drawn at about 677°C",
        "Steel is rapidly quenched in oil",
        "When alloy steels are rapidly quenched in water"
      ],
      "answer": "Quenching steel during transformation",
      "explanation": "Troostite is a microconstituent of steel that is formed by quenching during transformation from austenite. It is a very fine pearlite that is difficult to resolve with an optical microscope."

      "chapter": "Manufacturing",
      "question": "Induction hardening is the process of",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Hardening the core",
        "Uniform hardening",
        "Selective hardening",
        "Hardening surface for wear resistance"
      ],
      "answer": "Hardening surface for wear resistance",
      "explanation": "Induction hardening is a surface hardening process used to increase the wear resistance, surface hardness, and fatigue life of steel parts through a process of induction heating followed by quenching."

      "chapter": "Nuclear Engineering",
      "question": "Heavy water is used in atomic power plants as",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Fuel",
        "Source of energy",
        "Lubricant",
        "Moderator"
      ],
      "answer": "Moderator",
      "explanation": "Heavy water (D₂O) is used as a neutron moderator in some types of nuclear reactors. Its purpose is to slow down fast neutrons so that they are more likely to cause fission."

      "chapter": "Manufacturing",
      "question": "Which one is not the purpose of heat treatment of steels?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Changing the composition of steel on the surface",
        "Changing the percentage of carbon and Si in the bulk.",
        "Increasing or decreasing the grain size",
        "Removing undesirable residual stresses"
      ],
      "answer": "Changing the percentage of carbon and Si in the bulk.",
      "explanation": "Heat treatment alters the microstructure and properties of steel but does not change its bulk chemical composition (like the overall percentage of Carbon or Silicon)."

      "chapter": "Manufacturing",
      "question": "A cold chisel is made of",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Mild steel",
        "Cast iron",
        "H.S.S.",
        "High carbon steel"
      ],
      "answer": "High carbon steel",
      "explanation": "Cold chisels are made from high carbon steel, which can be hardened and tempered to provide a sharp, durable cutting edge capable of cutting cold metals."
