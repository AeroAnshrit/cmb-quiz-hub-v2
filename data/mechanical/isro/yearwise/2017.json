      "options": ["p, q and r", "q and r", "p and s", "p and r"],
      "answer": "p and r",
      "explanation": "Since pressure 'p' is uniform and blocks are dimensionally equal, the stress (P/A) is the same in both (p is correct). Since E1 > E2, strain (stress/E) will be different. Strain in M2 will be greater than M1, so block M2 will compress more, causing point B to move downward (r is correct)."

        "P/A each"
      ],
      "answer": "P/A each",
      "explanation": "From the geometry of similar triangles formed by deflection, Δ₂ = 2Δ₁. Since Δ = PL/AE, we get (P₂*2L)/AE = 2 * (P₁*L)/AE, which simplifies to P₂ = P₁. From moment equilibrium about A, 3P = P₁ + 2P₂. Substituting P₁=P₂ gives 3P = 3P₁, so P₁=P₂=P. Stress = P/A for both."

      "answer": "8 - j4π",
      "explanation": "Differentiating x and y with respect to t gives velocity components u and v. At t=0.5s, ωt = 4π. Since sin(4π)=0 and cos(4π)=1, the velocity vector V = [16t cos(ωt) - 8t²ω sin(ωt)]i + [-12t² sin(ωt) - 4t³ω cos(ωt)]j simplifies to V = (16*0.5*1 - 0)i + (0 - 4*(0.5)³*8π*1)j = 8i - 4πj."

      "options": ["173 N/mm²", "2.4 N/mm²", "85 N/mm²", "None of these"],
      "answer": "2.4 N/mm²",
      "explanation": "The weld length is 30mm (from the diagram). Primary shear stress = Load / (2 * length * throat_thickness). Throat thickness 't' = size * cos(45). The formula given in the solution P√2 / (2bs) seems to simplify this calculation where s=size. Stress = 1000 / (2 * 30 * 0.707 * 10) = 2.35 N/mm², which is close to 2.4 N/mm²."

      "options": ["ω₂ < ω₁", "ω₂ > ω₁", "ω₂ = ω₁", "Cannot be obtained from the given data"],
      "answer": "ω₂ > ω₁",
      "explanation": "Natural frequency ω is proportional to √(k/m). Stiffness k of a cantilever is proportional to EI/L³. If L becomes L/2, stiffness k becomes 8 times the original. Frequency is proportional to √k, so it increases. ω is inversely proportional to L², so halving the length increases the frequency by a factor of 4. The provided solution notes ω ∝ 1/L^(3/2), which also leads to an increase."

        "options": ["Soda ash", "Dilute acid", "Compressed air and sand particles", "Iron shots"],
        "answer": "Dilute acid",
        "explanation": "Pickling is a metal surface treatment that uses a dilute acid solution (pickle liquor) to remove impurities like stains, rust, or scale."

        "options": ["Mg", "Ni", "C", "Cr"],
        "answer": "Cr",
        "explanation": "Chromium (Cr) is the key alloying element that makes steel 'stainless' by forming a passive, corrosion-resistant chromium oxide layer on the surface. A minimum of 10.5% Cr is required."

        "answer": "Reversible Adiabatic Expansion",
        "explanation": "An isentropic process is one that is both adiabatic (no heat transfer) and reversible (no entropy generation). This combination results in a constant entropy process."

        "answer": "31-50% of work piece tolerance",
        "explanation": "Tooling and gauge design often follows the 'rule of ten', where the gauge tolerance is 10% of the workpiece tolerance. However, for tooling design itself, a wider range such as 31-50% is often cited in textbooks."

        ],
        "answer": "Normal Distribution is applied for discrete Random Distribution",
        "explanation": "The Normal Distribution is used for continuous random variables, not discrete ones. Distributions like the Binomial or Poisson are used for discrete variables."

        ],
        "answer": "Equal to adiabatic flame temperature",
        "explanation": "The adiabatic flame temperature is the maximum possible temperature achieved for a given fuel and oxidizer, which occurs when the combustion is complete (stoichiometric) and there are no heat losses."
