    {
      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "The pressure P of a gas in terms of its mean kinetic energy per unit volume E is equal to",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "E/3",
        "E/2",
        "3E/4",
        "2E/3"
      ],
      "answer": "2E/3",
      "explanation": "From the kinetic theory of gases, the pressure P exerted by an ideal gas is related to the mean kinetic energy per unit volume E by the equation P = (2/3)E."

    {
      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "Work done in a free expansion process is",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "+ve",
        "-ve",
        "zero",
        "none of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "zero",
      "explanation": "In a free expansion (or Joule expansion), a gas expands into a vacuum. Since there is no external pressure to work against, the work done by the gas is zero."

    {
      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "If the value of n is infinitely large in a polytropic process PVⁿ = C, then the process is known as constant",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "volume",
        "pressure",
        "temperature",
        "entropy"
      ],
      "answer": "volume",
      "explanation": "In a polytropic process PVⁿ = C, if n approaches infinity, the process becomes an isochoric (constant volume) process. This can be seen by rewriting the equation as P^(1/n)V = C^(1/n). As n→∞, 1/n→0, and P⁰V = C', which means V = constant."

    {
      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "One kg of carbon monoxide requires how much quantity of oxygen to produce 11/7 kg of carbon dioxide gas?",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "4/7 kg",
        "11/4 kg",
        "9/7 kg",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "4/7 kg",
      "explanation": "The chemical reaction is 2CO + O₂ → 2CO₂. The molar masses are CO≈28, O₂≈32, CO₂≈44. This means 56 kg of CO reacts with 32 kg of O₂ to produce 88 kg of CO₂. To produce 11/7 kg of CO₂, we need (32/88) * (11/7) = (4/11) * (11/7) = 4/7 kg of O₂."
