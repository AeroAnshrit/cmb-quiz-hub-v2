      "question": "A cylindrical body of cross-sectional area A, height H and density ρs, is immersed to a depth h in a liquid of density ρ, and tied to the bottom with a string. The tension in the string is",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "ρghA",
        "(ρh - ρs H)gA",
        "(ρ - ρs) ghA",
        "(ρs - ρ) ghA"
      ],
      "answer": "(ρh - ρs H)gA",
      "explanation": "The forces acting on the body are: Tension (T) downwards, Weight (W = ρs g H A) downwards, and Buoyant force (FB = ρ g h A) upwards. For equilibrium, T + W = FB, so T = FB - W = ρghA - ρsgHA = gA(ρh - ρsH)."

      "question": "A manometer measures the pressure differential between two locations of a pipe carrying water. If the manometric liquid is mercury (specific gravity 13.6) and the manometer showed a level difference of 20cm, then the pressure head difference of water between the two tapings will be",

        "2.72m",
        "1.36m",
        "2.52m"
      ],
      "answer": "2.52m",
      "explanation": "The pressure head difference in terms of the flowing fluid (water) is given by h = x(S_m/S_f - 1), where x is the manometer reading, S_m is the specific gravity of the manometric fluid, and S_f is the specific gravity of the flowing fluid. h = 0.20m * (13.6/1 - 1) = 0.20 * 12.6 = 2.52m."

      "question": "Flow takes place at Reynolds Number of 1500 in two different pipes with relative roughness of 0.001 and 0.002. The friction factor",
      "image": "",
      "options": [
        "Will be higher for the pipe with relative roughness of 0.001",
        "Will be higher for the pipe having relative roughness of 0.002",
        "Will be the same in both the pipes",
        "In the two pipes cannot be compared on the basis of data given"
      ],
      "answer": "Will be the same in both the pipes",
      "explanation": "A Reynolds number of 1500 indicates that the flow is laminar (since it's less than the critical value of ~2100). In the laminar flow regime, the friction factor is given by f = 64/Re and is independent of the pipe's relative roughness."

      "question": "A liquid compressed in cylinder has a volume of 0.04m³ at 50 kg/cm² and a volume of 0.039m³ at 150 kg/cm². The bulk modulus of elasticity of liquid is",

        "4000 kg/cm²"
      ],
      "answer": "4000 kg/cm²",
      "explanation": "Bulk Modulus K = -V(dP/dV). Approximating, K ≈ -V₁(ΔP/ΔV) = -0.04 * (150-50)/(0.039-0.04) = -0.04 * (100)/(-0.001) = 4000 kg/cm²."
