    {
      "chapter": "Thermodynamics",
      "question": "For an isentropic process of an ideal gas, which relation holds? (where γ = Cp/Cv)",
      "options": [
        "pV = constant",
        "pV^γ = constant",
        "T/V = constant",
        "p/T = constant"
      ],
      "answer": "pV^γ = constant",
      "explanation": "For a reversible adiabatic (isentropic) process, the relation PV^γ = constant is valid for an ideal gas."
