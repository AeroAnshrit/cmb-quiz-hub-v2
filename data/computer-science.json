      "question": "Which data structure uses LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)?",
      "options": ["Queue", "Stack", "Linked List", "Tree"],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is LIFO(Last In First Out)."

      "question": "What is the time complexity of a binary search algorithm?",
      "options": ["O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(n^2)", "O(1)"],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) because it halves the search space with each comparison, making it very efficient for sorted arrays."
