    "options": ["O(nÂ²)", "O(n log n)", "O(n)", "O(log n)"],
    "answer": "O(n log n)",
    "explanation": "Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm. Its time complexity is consistently O(n log n) in the best, average, and worst cases because it always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge them."
