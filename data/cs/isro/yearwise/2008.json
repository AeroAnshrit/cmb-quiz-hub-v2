      "question": "Which of the following is an illegal array definition?",
      "options": [
        "type COLOGNE: (LIME, PINE, MUSK,MENTHOL); var a : array [COLOGNE] of REAL;",
        "var a: array [REAL] of REAL;",
        "vara: array [A’.’Z'] of REAL;",
        "vara: array [BOOLEAN] of REAL;"
      ],
      "answer": "var a: array [REAL] of REAL;",
      "explanation": "In many programming languages like Pascal, the bounds of an array must be a discrete ordinal type, not a real number type. `REAL` is not a valid type for an array index."

      "question": "The term Phong is associated with",
      "options": [
        "Ray tracing",
        "shading",
        "Hiddenline removal",
        "a game"
      ],
      "answer": "shading",
      "explanation": "The Phong reflection model is an empirical model for the local illumination of points on a surface, widely used in 3D computer graphics for shading."

      "question": "The subnet mask 255.255.255.192",
      "options": [
        "extends the network portion to 16 bits",
        "extends the network portion to 26 bits",
        "extends the network portion to 36 bits",
        "has no effect on the networkportion of an IP address"
      ],
      "answer": "extends the network portion to 26 bits",
      "explanation": "The subnet mask 255.255.255.192 in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000. This has 26 ones, which means it extends the network portion of the address to 26 bits."
