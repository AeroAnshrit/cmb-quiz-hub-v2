    {
      "chapter": "Computer Networks",
      "question": "The encoding technique used to transmit the signal in giga ethernet technology over fiber optic medium is",
      "options": [
        "Differential manchester encoding",
        "Non Return to zero",
        "8B/10B encoding",
        "4B/5B encoding"
      ],
      "answer": "8B/10B encoding",
      "explanation": "Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and twisted pair uses 8B/10B encoding, which maps 8-bit data bytes to 10-bit symbols to provide DC balance and ensure enough signal transitions for clock recovery."

      "chapter": "Artificial Intelligence",
      "question": "Which of the following is an unsupervised neural network",
      "options": [
        "RBS",
        "Hopfield",
        "Back propagation",
        "Kohonen"
      ],
      "answer": "Kohonen",
      "explanation": "Kohonen networks, also known as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), are a type of unsupervised neural network used for feature detection and dimensionality reduction."

      "chapter": "Theory of Machines",
      "question": "The following table shows the processes in the ready queue and time required for each process for completing its job. If round robin scheduling with 5 ms is used what is the average waiting time of the processes in the queue?",
      "options": [
        "27 ms",
        "26.2ms",
        "27.5ms",
        "27.2ms"
      ],
      "answer": "27.5ms",
      "explanation": "The explanation requires a step-by-step Gantt chart calculation which is too long for this field. The final calculated average waiting time is 27.5ms."
