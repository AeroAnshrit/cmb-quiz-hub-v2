      "question": "Which of the given number has its IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point representation as (0 10000000 110 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000)",
      "options": ["2.5", "3.0", "3.5", "4.5"],
      "answer": "3.5",
      "explanation": "Sign bit = 0 (positive). Exponent = 10000000₂ = 128. Bias = 127. So, actual exponent = 128 - 127 = 1. Mantissa = 1.110...₂ = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1.75. The number is +1.75 * 2¹ = 3.5."

      "question": "The range of integers that can be represented by an n-bit 2's complement number system is",
      "options": ["-2ⁿ⁻¹ to (2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1)", "-2(2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1) to (2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1)", "-2ⁿ⁻¹ to 2ⁿ⁻¹", "-2(2ⁿ⁻¹ + 1) to (2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1)"],
      "answer": "-2ⁿ⁻¹ to (2ⁿ⁻¹ - 1)",
      "explanation": "The standard range for an n-bit two's complement integer is from -2^(n-1) (for the most negative number, e.g., 1000...0) to 2^(n-1) - 1 (for the most positive number, e.g., 0111...1)."

      "options": ["10 flip-flops", "12 flip-flops", "8 flip-flops", "6 flip-flops"],
      "answer": "12 flip-flops",
      "explanation": "A standard ring counter has a number of states equal to the number of flip-flops used. Therefore, a modulus-12 (12-state) ring counter requires 12 flip-flops."
