    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What is the unit of electrical resistance?",
      "options": ["Volt", "Ampere", "Ohm", "Watt"],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Ohm (Î©) is the SI unit of electrical resistance, named after German physicist Georg Ohm."
    },

      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Ohm's law is given by which equation?",
      "options": ["V = I/R", "V = IR", "R = V*I", "I = V*R"],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ohm's law states that the voltage (V) across a conductor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it, provided all physical conditions and temperatures remain constant. The formula is V = IR."

    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "In a series circuit, which of the following remains constant across all components?",
      "options": ["Voltage", "Current", "Resistance", "Power"],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In a series circuit, the electrical current is the same through all components. The total voltage is the sum of the voltages across each component."
